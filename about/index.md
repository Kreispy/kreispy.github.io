My name is Chris Chow and I am currently a Software Engineer at [Conductor, Inc](http://www.conductor.com/).

On May 19, 2014 I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania where I majored in Computer Science.
My resume is available to be viewed [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/35563338/christopher_chow_resume.pdf).
I moved to New York city in May 2015 have lived here since then.

I am a second generation Chinese-American, born and raised by an extremely caring, hardworking and obstinate single mother. 
Growing up, I learned how to do more with less and by extension how to stretch every dollar.
