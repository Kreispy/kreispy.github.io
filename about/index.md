My name is Chris Chow and I am currently a Software Engineer at [VTS](https://www.vts.com/), a commercial real estate tech company in New York City, working with Rails and Angular. Previously I worked at [Hightower](https://www.gethightower.com/) before the company [merged with VTS](https://www.vts.com/in-the-news/vts-and-hightower-announce-strategic-merger). Many many moons ago, on May 19, 2014, I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania where I majored in Computer Science.

Practicality rooted in altruism is my approach to software; I am motivated to solve (real) customer problem by developing functional and ergonomic software. I strive to be an empathetic, impactful, and transparent engineer.
