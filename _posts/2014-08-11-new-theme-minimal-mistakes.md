I have spent the past two weeks revamping my theme. I searched for the subjectively best open sourced jekyll-based theme out there.
My search led me to this current theme, Minimal Mistakes by Michael Rose. This aesthetically pleasing and minimalist theme is exactly 
what I desired in a personal website. The creator also provides sufficient documentation to allow for adjustments and customization
to the theme. For example, I added the email button to the column with the rest of the social media buttons. The version of this theme 
that I cloned did not display the email address. After reading through the detailed documentation and commit messages on the project repository, 
I managed to get the button to display.
