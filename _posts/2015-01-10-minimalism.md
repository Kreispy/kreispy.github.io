Happy new year! For my first post of 2015, I would like to share [this link](http://mnmlist.com/quotes/) of minimalist quotes.

Here are a few of my favorites:

> Fear less, hope more; eat less, chew more; whine less, breathe more; talk less, say more; love more, and all good things will be yours. 
-- Swedish Proverb

> The secret of happiness, you see, is not found in seeking more, but in developing the capacity to enjoy less. 
-- Socrates

> Great acts are made up of small deeds. 
-- Lao Tzu
