# Theme Change
I have, once again, changed my website theme. This time I chose an even more minimalist presentation. 

# Reflection
One year and two months have elapsed since I moved out to New York city to work as a Software Engineer at Conductor. 
Once it hit the one year mark, I increasingly reflected upon the past year and whether or not I wanted to continue working for the same company. 
After many fierce conversations with coworkers and friends from college, I decided to actively search for opportunities elsewhere. 
The deciding question that cemented my feelings is: was I enjoying my time working for this company? The answer boiled down to a definitive *no*. 

My current work, while sufficiently challenging, did not appeal to my sense of pragmatism or altruism -- I work for very little gratification.
After working on a digital marketing SaaS platform for over a year, I have become severely turned off by "digital marketing" software.
It honestly felt like working at a bank, but without the suffocating bureaucratic culture and business casual dress code.
I increasingly dread going to work with each passing day.

Computer science is inherently *accessible*, *democratic*, *disruptive*, and *modern*. The word "disruptive" is rather cliche, but it is apt.
By extension, I believe technology companies should create products that espouse these really principles. 
Furthermore, this is still compatible with capitalistic business models, especially when the product non-trivially benefits the user.

At the end of the day, I should not feel bad about putting my needs first.
