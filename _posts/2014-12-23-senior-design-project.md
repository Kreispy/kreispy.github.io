# Gesture Gym: my final undergraduate projects
-----
Gesture Gym is a therapeutic tablet application designed to complement traditional physical therapy.
Traditional physical therapy is inconvenient, expensive, mundane and isolated. Furthermore, 
there is a general lack of quantitative data on the issue; doctors collect very little numerical data on
the therapy they conduct. 

Inspired by popular rhythm game [osu!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osu!), Gesture Gym is a project
intended to engage, entertain, and mildly rehabilitate the player. Rehabilitation in a game
context allows the patient to temporarily escape reality and enjoy the pseudo-fantasy of our game.

Player progress and data is collected by the application, allowing Gesture Gym to analyze patient performance. 
With continuous use, the data becomes more and more robust and informative to the players and the therapist.
The difficulty level adapts to the patient's recent progress in order to further facilitate improvement.
