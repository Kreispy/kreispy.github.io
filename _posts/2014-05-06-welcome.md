I have been thinking about making a personal website for a very long 
time. There are multitudes of options and I never quite found one
that I liked until now. A jekyll powered github page was the near
perfect fit. This open sourced setup greatly appealed to my sense of
minimalism. 

###Who (am I)?
I, Christopher Derek Chow, am a soon to be graduate of the 
University of Pennsylvania. I will graduate with a Bachelors of 
Science in Engineering in Computer Science. I was a
Computer Science major and Mathematics minor.

I am a second generation Chinese immigrant from a single parent 
family (你好,妈妈). Born and raised in the city of Philadelphia, I have lived
in this city for my all 22 years of my life.

###What (am I doing)?
Documenting my notable experiences and adventures.

###When (am I)?

Ha, lame time travel joke. The current time is 1:06 AM on May 9th, 2014.

###Where (am I)?
I am currently still living in Philadelphia

###Why (am I doing this)?
In the past I have used Xanga, MySpace, Blogspot, Livejournal, and 
Tumblr for my blogging needs. I would start strong, but it was not 
long until I lost interest. Furthermore, I did not have local copies of 
my posts. This personal site not only serves as a professional 
resource, but also a centralized personalized blogging platform.

###How (am I doing this)?
This is a static website hosted freely on github. My page is powered
by Jekyll: "a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for 
personal, project, or organization sites." I edit all of my posts locally
and then push it to the corresponding github repository.
