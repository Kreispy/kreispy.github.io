I believe that everything boils down to being a function of space and time --- to be at the right place at the right moment.
The exact details behind this supposed function is, of course, a mystery. Being a fan of science-fiction, I like to entertain
these kinds of ideas.

Space and time can be viewed as where and when you are. Who and what you are is based on the conditions that brought about 
the present situation. I think these very conditions are dependent on time and space. I admit that this is overly generalized. 
Anyhow, this elicits a very recursive idea that where and when you presently are depends on where and when you were previously.
