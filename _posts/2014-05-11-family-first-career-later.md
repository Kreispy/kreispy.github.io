My family is on the lower end of the socio-economic ladder. My mom, in the recent past,
worked 105 hour weeks, working for 15 hours from 7am to 10pm each 
day of the week at a laundromat. Periodically, through out my entire 
time as an undergrad, I had to go to the laundromat and help her. 
The self-service laundromat uses a card system for payment processing. 
My mom speaks just enough English to get by, so she can handle the 
customers. However, whenever a washer, dryer or card-related machine
malfunctions, then it is my responsibility. There would be a machine
issue at least once every two weeks. In addition to what I had to learn
and study for classes, I had to learn how to diagnose and fix these 
machines. Thing I learned how to fix include replacing dryer belts, 
washer belts, and replacing dryer ignition boxes. Other tasks include
repairing security cameras and setting up remote monitoring. 
Furthermore, any bill disputes, mail and any related paperwork was my responsibility.
Not to mention any of the house related paperwork. As a member of this small family, 
I understood and acknowledged my duties and responsibilities.

# Present Situation
It is nearing the end of my four years at the University of Pennsylvania.
Within less than two weeks, I will become the first in my family to
graduate from college. Transitioning from high school to college was
an extremely difficult and challenging process, but I think I handled it
sufficiently well. I found a major that I thoroughly enjoyed, joined 
organizations that I am passionate about, made many lifelong friends 
and had many meaningful and memorable experiences. At this point
in my life, I am transitioning from a life of education into finding a 
job in the real world. This transition has much more difficult and 
frustrating. I could handle classes, extracurriculars, and my familial
responsibilities. The straw that broke the back of this camel is 
the professional development and job search. 

I studied Computer Science and so I naturally sought jobs as a
software engineer where I would not only utilize my education, but
also work with what I enjoy. I hit repeated roadblocks in my job 
search. In the process of seeking a full-time job, many recruiters 
cited my lack of summer internships. Unlike my peers who sought and
obtained software engineering internships at reputable companies, I
was not fortunate enough to even apply for them. My past three summers 
consisted of me working with my mom, and helping the store. She rarely gets 
the opportunity for a full nights rest, so my weekly visits and 
"summer breaks" were her chance for a rest. I presented a condensed summary 
of how I spent my summers to recruiters, but it was seemingly brushed aside. 

One recruiter explicitly stated that my lack of internships is why 
I was not given additional interviews. Despite my successful first interview, 
the lack of internship experience is the reason why I was removed from consideration. 
Granted, this was an isolated incident, I was extremely frustrated, 
baffled, and mildly depressed. A person disregarded my family 
situation, my mom's efforts, and my efforts. They ignored why I 
legitimately could not be away from my family. Did they think it was 
a valid option to let my mom work herself into utter exhaustion? 
Working is her primary livelihood; quitting was not an option to her.

Is technical recruiting so rigid that those with unique circumstances 
and less fortunate backgrounds are removed from consideration? 
I have been building my coding portfolio in the midst of problem
sets, projects, exams, and family responsibilities. I believe that I 
have more than demonstrated my competence and passion for
computer science.
