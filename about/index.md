My name is Christopher Chow, but you can call me Chris.

I am a second generation Chinese-American, born and raised by an extremely caring, hardworking and obstinate single mother.  
On May 19, 2014 I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania where I majored in Computer Science. 
You may view my resume [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/35563338/christopher_chow_resume.pdf).
I believe in doing-it-yourself, though I am not going to try to reinvent the wheel.
