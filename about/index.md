My name is Christopher Chow, but most people call me Chris.

On May 19, 2014 I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania where I majored in Computer Science.
My resume is available to be viewed [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/35563338/christopher_chow_resume.pdf).

I am a second generation Chinese-American, born and raised by an extremely caring, hardworking and obstinate single mother. 
Growing up, I learned how to do more with less and by extension how to stretch every dollar.
During my freshman year at Penn, I searched for a major that best demonstrated these values of frugal effectiveness.
The field of computer science, in its vast breadth and immense depth, strongly reflected my personal values.
