# Theme Change
I have, once again, changed my website theme. This time I chose an even more minimalist presentation. 

# Reflection
It has been one year and two months since I moved out to New York city to work as a Software Engineer at Conductor. 
As soon it hit the one year mark, I reflected upon the past year and whether or not I wanted to continue working for the same company.
After many conversations with coworkers and friends from college, I have decided to actively search for opportunities elsewhere.
